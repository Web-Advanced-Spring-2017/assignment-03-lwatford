# Assignment 03

## Assignment Specification
I created a data visualization using socket.io. It tracks how many users go to the page and adds a line using socket.io and emits how many times the site has been clicked. 

The awesome part is thaat by coding io.sockets.emit it emits in real time! Fun, right! Super cool.

CHALLENGES: were setting up the lines to run based on the launch of the website, at first I was working with mouse pressed but it didn't work. The "for loop" made this project more siccessful.  

When you type www.localhost:8080/home will allow you to press the registration button it pulls the registration numbers from the json file I scraped the data from http://www.adoptiondatabase.org/ using ParseHub!!!

WHAT I LIKED: scrapping the data was pretty fun!
